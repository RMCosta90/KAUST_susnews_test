    <p>
    Each year, KAUST’s <abbr title="Health, Safety, and Environment">HSE</abbr> Biodiversity team leads an educational and outreach program that provides a holistic exploration of freshwater ecosystems. Through more than [X] activities&mdash;including fieldwork, citizen-science projects, and environmental awareness events&mdash;the program engages an average of [X] community members annually. Given the absence of natural freshwater watersheds in our desert climate, this stream focuses on the University’s man-made freshwater lake, a semi-protected area that serves both as a biodiversity haven and as a practical model for sustainable water management.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lake’s water originates from KAUST’s treated wastewater, demonstrating how reclaimed resources can sustain vibrant ecosystems that support migratory birds, aquatic insects, and diverse plant life. Pesticide and insecticide use is deliberately minimized as part of its management strategy, maintaining a healthy balance among vegetation, soil, and the wildlife that depends on them.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of the program, activities are tailored for the wider community, particularly students from The KAUST School across K&ndash;12 levels. Using the lake as a living model, students learn field monitoring techniques, conduct water and soil quality analyses, interpret their findings, and present their results in class or during community exhibitions. In collaboration with the KAUST Birding Club, community members also help observe and record migratory bird species that rely on the lake’s habitat, with the collected data shared with HSE to strengthen biodiversity monitoring. Through these hands-on experiences, participants develop a deeper understanding of the vital connections between water quality, soil health, and overall ecosystem resilience.
  </p>

  <p>
    By showcasing how reclaimed water can sustain life beyond human use, the program underscores KAUST’s commitment to fostering ecosystems where people and nature coexist in balance.
