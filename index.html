    Each year, KAUST’s <abbr title="Health, Safety, and Environment">HSE</abbr> Biodiversity team leads an educational program that deepens community understanding of freshwater ecosystems. Through more than [X] activities&mdash;including fieldwork, citizen-science initiatives, and environmental awareness events&mdash;the program engages an average of [X] community members annually.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the absence of natural freshwater watersheds along Saudi Arabia’s desert coast, the University’s man-made freshwater lakes within the Golf Course area serve as the central platform for these outreach efforts. These semi-protected habitats not only support resident and migratory birds, aquatic insects, and amphibians but also provide a living example of how water can be reclaimed and managed sustainably to sustain biodiversity in arid environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    During these community-based learning activities, participants explore KAUST’s water cycle and learn how all wastewater on campus is treated&mdash;part of it used for irrigation and part redirected to feed the lakes&mdash;creating an artificial oasis capable of sustaining life beyond human needs. Pesticide and insecticide use is deliberately minimized as part of the lake management strategy, helping maintain a healthy balance between vegetation, soil, and the wildlife that depends on them.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of the program, activities are tailored for the wider community, particularly students from The KAUST School across K&ndash;12 levels. Using the lakes as living models, students learn field monitoring techniques, conduct water and soil quality analyses, connect their findings to ecosystem health, and present their results in class or during community exhibitions. In collaboration with the KAUST Birding Club, community members also help observe and record migratory and resident bird species that rely on the lakes’ habitat, with the collected data shared with HSE to strengthen biodiversity monitoring. Through these hands-on experiences, participants develop a deeper understanding of the vital connections between sustainable water management and overall ecosystem resilience.
  </p>

  <p>
    By showcasing how reclaimed water can sustain life beyond human use, the program underscores KAUST’s commitment to fostering ecosystems where people and nature coexist in balance.
