  Each year, KAUST’s Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Biodiversity team leads an educational program that deepens community understanding of freshwater ecosystems. Through more than [X] activities—including fieldwork, citizen-science initiatives, and environmental awareness events—the program engages an average of [X] community members annually. In the absence of natural freshwater watersheds along Saudi Arabia’s desert coast, the University’s man-made freshwater lake serves as the central platform for these outreach efforts. This semi-protected habitat not only supports migratory birds, aquatic insects, and amphibians but also provides a living example of sustainable water management in arid environments. </p>

  <p>
 During these community-based learning activities, participants explore how the lake’s water—sourced from KAUST’s treated wastewater—demonstrates the potential of reclaimed resources to sustain life beyond human needs. Pesticide and insecticide use is deliberately minimized as part of its management strategy, helping maintain a healthy balance among vegetation, soil, and the wildlife that depends on them.  </p>

  <p>
    As part of the program, activities are tailored for the wider community, particularly students from The KAUST School across K&ndash;12 levels. Using the lake as a living model, students learn field monitoring techniques, conduct water and soil quality analyses, interpret their findings, and present their results in class or during community exhibitions. In collaboration with the KAUST Birding Club, community members also help observe and record migratory bird species that rely on the lake’s habitat, with the collected data shared with HSE to strengthen biodiversity monitoring. Through these hands-on experiences, participants develop a deeper understanding of the vital connections between water quality, soil health, and overall ecosystem resilience.

  <p>
    By showcasing how reclaimed water can sustain life beyond human use, the program underscores KAUST’s commitment to fostering ecosystems where people and nature coexist in balance.
