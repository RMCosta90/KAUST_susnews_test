  <p>Across the year, KAUST quietly transformed its campus, outreach channels, and research platforms into a living bridge between freshwater sources, coastal systems, and reef horizons. The arid landscapes of the Kingdom may suggest distance from aquatic abundance, yet what unfolded in 2024 was a narrative of connection: from inland aquifers to sea currents, from classrooms to national fishery workshops, and from microbes to coral nurseries. Through education, community engagement, applied research, and cross-sector partnerships, KAUST demonstrated how aquatic ecosystem stewardship can root itself in local communities and feed into the national vision.</p>
<p>In early March, KAUST’s <a href="https://sustainability.kaust.edu.sa/events/world-water-day-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Water Day</a> celebrations set the tone. Students from The KAUST School (TKS) presented imaginative projects on water scarcity, stepping beyond textbook lessons into hands-on problem-solving. The campus opened its Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) plant for guided tours, part of an educational programme on freshwater ecosystem management in a desert context, allowing community members to trace the journey of desalinated water and reflect on the interconnected flows that underpin coastal and inland ecosystems. A <a href="https://thelens.kaust.edu.sa/amp/world-water-day-2024-at-kaust/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature walk</a> along the pier, led by KAUST’s Health, Safety &amp; Environment team together with the Birding Club and Students for Sustainability, enabled participants to observe mangroves, shorebirds, and fish species—an outreach programme on freshwater ecosystems by way of observing groundwater discharge, mangrove fringes, and near-shore biodiversity. These efforts helped bring freshwater-system awareness into the community and placed infrastructure and ecosystem health into everyday view.</p>

<p>When June arrived, the celebration of <a href="https://sustainability.kaust.edu.sa/events/world-ocean-day-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Oceans Day</a> broadened the scope from rivers and plants to waves and reefs. KAUST opened its Waste-Water Treatment Plant and the SWRO facility once more, this time to illustrate how reuse and desalination connect with marine influxes and reef-edge health. In parallel, visitors toured the Coastal &amp; Marine Resources Core Lab (CMR), where research vessels, diving excursions, and instrumentation reveal the hidden life of the Red Sea. By drawing links between freshwater input, groundwater discharge, coastal fringe habitats, and reef systems, the programme reinforced that community immersion matters: an educational programme for local communities not just about oceans, but about ecosystems under threat and the role freshwater plays in them.</p>
<p>On the national front, KAUST extended its reach through its <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/news/transforming-the-future-of-saudi-aquaculture-through-kaust-s-partnership-with-mewa?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquaculture Development Program (ADP)</a>, developed in partnership with the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture (MEWA). Launched in June 2024, the programme trained local technicians and national-level participants in hatchery operations, feed formulation, and offshore cage systems; a clear educational programme on aquaculture and tourism (since coastal fish farms often tie into coastal-tourism economies), and educational programmes for both local communities (trainees on campus) and national communities (industry and government). In November, KAUST hosted its 6th International Saudi Aquaculture Development Workshop, where presentations revealed over 30 new feed formulations improving feed-conversion and energy-use efficiency—with the potential to save <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/news/saudi-could-save-millions-as-aquaculture-industry-grows?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USD 417 million per year</a> if scaled. The dual goal: strengthen the seafood sector and reduce pressure on wild fish stocks, while raising awareness of sustainable management of fisheries, thus community outreach on sustainable management of fisheries.</p>
<p>[URIS id=12791]</p>
<p>Elsewhere along the coastline, KAUST’s Beacon Development team convened <a href="https://sustainability.kaust.edu.sa/news-center/fisheries-stakeholder-workshops-to-tackle-overfishing-and-conservation-efforts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stakeholder workshops in Tabuk in October</a>. Fishermen, government officials, local community leaders, and scientists gathered around the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF), illegal-fishing counter-measures, and the draft NEOM Nature Reserve Fisheries Management Plan. This community outreach on sustainable management of fisheries brought grassroots voices, regional policy, and scientific input into dialogue—embedding educational programmes for local and national communities in marine-ecosystem health.</p>
<p>On the research front, KAUST reaffirmed its commitment to ecosystems under threat and technological solutions. In December 2024, the launch of the <a href="https://sustainability.kaust.edu.sa/news-center/new-international-water-research-center-to-advance-water-security/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Water Research Center</a>, in collaboration with MEWA, signalled a national platform for applied research into water security, pollution-treatment technologies, digital monitoring, and ecosystem services. Though freshwater-driven, the centre’s ecosystem lens emphasises the flow between land and sea. At the same time, Professor Raquel Peixoto, the marine microbiologist whose <a href="https://www.notion.so/Safeguarding-the-Waters-that-Sustain-Life-293dce52ee2b808ba4fcf46d01645fbf?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research on coral-probiotic applications</a> earned her the <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/news/kaust-professor-wins-frontiers-science-prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 Frontiers Planet Prize (“Coral Warrior”)</a>, continued to advance understanding of how microbial consortia can bolster reef resilience and reduce ecosystem damage. Her team’s work on beneficial microorganisms for corals shows how science can help protect aquatic plants and animals indirectly, through microbial interventions rather than direct restocking. Elsewhere, a KAUST research team <a href="https://www.notion.so/77e3a6f0ae4a413fa5d3630b04f52f38?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on the hidden diversity of Red Sea gobies</a> and other reef fishes, reinforcing how biodiversity assessment supports ecosystem-based management. These pieces of work underscore the interconnectedness of freshwater input, coastal habitats, reef biodiversity, and human use.</p>
<p>In an added outreach dimension, KAUST offered a seldom-noted freshwater field visit in 2024: as part of a campus summer-internship programme, youth groups visited the campus artificial lake system and the adjacent mangrove nursery, part of the KAUST Birding Club and Sustainability Office’s nature-outreach series. Participants engaged in a guided mangrove-planting session, learned about tidal groundwater discharge, and documented juvenile-fish use of brackish water zones. This outreach programme on freshwater ecosystems (and linkages with brackish/estuarine zones) helped local community members understand how inland-surface water, groundwater, and coastal habitats form a network of life, and how human infrastructure must respect that web.</p>
<p>From the shores of the Red Sea to the inland water cycle, KAUST’s efforts in 2024 revealed a living continuum between research, education, and environmental care. Each initiative—whether training future aquaculture specialists, engaging coastal communities in sustainable fishing, carting students through mangrove-nursery fieldwork, or opening campus infrastructure to public tours—reflected a belief that stewardship grows through shared understanding. By linking scientific discovery with practical experience, KAUST helped people across the Kingdom see how every drop, stream, and tide connects in sustaining both ecosystems and livelihoods.</p>
<p>As the Kingdom advances its Vision 2030 goals, KAUST’s work this year illustrated how local learning and national innovation can converge to safeguard aquatic ecosystems. The stories of students walking among mangroves, fishermen mapping catch data, researchers designing coral-microbe solutions, and aquaculture technologists refining feed all combine into a narrative of connectivity, action, and future resilience. In this flow between local action and global vision, the University’s 2024 journey stands as a compelling chapter in the collective effort to protect life below water.</p>
