  <p>As the calendar turns, it is clear that this past year has been one of vivid convergence at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), where education, research, community outreach and national ambition have intertwined around the precious theme of aquatic environments, from freshwater sources through to marine and coastal systems.</p>
<p>In early March, KAUST marked World Water Day with a campus-wide immersion into the story of water. Students from The KAUST School (TKS) presented their own creative ideas addressing water scarcity, then toured the campus seawater reverse-osmosis facility to see how <a href="https://sustainability.kaust.edu.sa/events/world-water-day-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40,000 m³/day of potable water are produced</a>; opening up the workings of desalination, reuse and infrastructure to the community. A <a href="https://thelens.kaust.edu.sa/amp/world-water-day-2024-at-kaust/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature walk</a> along the pier, guided by the Health, Safety &amp; Environment team with participation from the Birding Club and Students for Sustainability, offered participants a window into mangroves, fish and local aquatic life and a reflection on how freshwater flows and coastal ecosystems intertwine.</p>
<p>In June, the celebration of <a href="https://sustainability.kaust.edu.sa/events/world-ocean-day-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Oceans Day</a> expanded that narrative. Community tours of KAUST’s Waste Water Treatment Plant and the Seawater RO plant showed firsthand how campus infrastructure connects with the sea, while a guided visit to the Coastal &amp; Marine Resources Core Lab (CMR) introduced local participants to marine research vessels, instrumentation and the role of science in protecting our oceans. These experiences engaged local communities, sharpening awareness of the linkages between freshwater management, groundwater discharge, coastal habitats and reef health.</p>
<p>Outreach reached deeper into national-scale capacity-building via the aquaculture front. In June 2024 KAUST and the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture (MEWA) launched a partnership under the Aquaculture Development Program (ADP) aimed at building a home-grown industry for Saudi Arabia. As part of that <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/news/transforming-the-future-of-saudi-aquaculture-through-kaust-s-partnership-with-mewa?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">program</a>, KAUST welcomed trainees in hatchery practices, feed formulation, and offshore cage systems; extending education to national-level actors and industries. By mid-November the KAUST-hosted 6th International Saudi Aquaculture Development Workshop revealed more than 30 new feed formulations, improving feed conversion by 10–15% and energy conversion by 15–35%, with potential <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/news/saudi-could-save-millions-as-aquaculture-industry-grows?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost‐savings of USD 417 million</a> per year if scaled. This harnesses aquaculture not only as a food-security lever but also as a means of relieving pressure on wild fish stocks and advancing sustainable use of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, coastal fisheries and local communities became an arena for direct dialogue and capability-building. In October, KAUST Beacon Development convened stakeholder <a href="https://sustainability.kaust.edu.sa/news-center/fisheries-stakeholder-workshops-to-tackle-overfishing-and-conservation-efforts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workshops</a> in Tabuk that brought together fishermen, ministries, local community leaders and conservation agencies to discuss the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF), illegal-fishing counter-measures and the draft NEOM Nature Reserve Fisheries Management Plan. These workshops are a prime example of educational programmes for local and national communities on sustainable management of fisheries, linking grassroots knowledge with policy and science to promote healthier marine systems.</p>
<p>On the research front, KAUST advanced collaborative work on ecosystems under threat. For example, the establishment in December of the new International <a href="https://sustainability.kaust.edu.sa/news-center/new-international-water-research-center-to-advance-water-security/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Research Center</a>, a KAUST-MEWA partnership announced during the UNCCD COP16 high-level session, will focus on pollution treatment, digital monitoring, advanced technologies, and bring global dialogue into national context. This centre will leverage industry and government partnerships, offering a platform where aquatic ecosystem health, freshwater inflows and local communities converge.</p>
<p>Across these activities a clear thread emerges: technologies and practices that aim to minimise damage to aquatic ecosystems are not being developed in isolation; they are being translated into outreach, education and operational programmes. The guided campus tours of the desalination and wastewater-treatment plants empowered local awareness of infrastructure and impact; the aquaculture training and feed-innovation workshops helped embed research into industry practice; the fisheries engagement enabled local providers of aquatic resources to become informed stewards; the new research centre provides a focal point for developing solutions and transmitting them into the community and national systems.</p>
<p>From the shores of the Red Sea to the inland water cycle, KAUST’s efforts in 2024 revealed a living continuum between research, education, and environmental care. Each initiative, whether training future aquaculture specialists, engaging coastal communities in sustainable fishing, or opening campus facilities to public learning, reflected a belief that stewardship grows through shared understanding. By linking scientific discovery with practical experience, KAUST helped people across the Kingdom see how every drop, stream, and tide connects in sustaining both ecosystems and livelihoods.</p>
<p>As the Kingdom pursues ambitious national transformation goals, KAUST’s efforts ripple outward: locally in coastal communities, nationally across industries and government, and globally through partnerships and platforms that connect Saudi Arabia to broader blue-economy and ecosystem-conservation discourses. The stories of students walking among mangroves, fishermen mapping catch data, researchers designing probiotic coral-resilience systems and aquaculture technologists measuring feed conversion all combine into a narrative of connectivity, action and future resilience.</p>
<p>The year’s achievements showed that progress happens where curiosity meets collaboration. Students tracing mangrove roots, fishermen co-designing resource plans, and researchers restoring coral reefs all contributed to the same current of purpose — safeguarding the waters that sustain life. In this flow between local action and global vision, KAUST’s 2024 journey stood as a testament to Saudi Arabia’s growing commitment to the world’s shared goal of protecting life below water.</p>
