  <p><strong>KAUST’s Nature Conservation Area</strong></p>
<p>KAUST is the custodian of a significant span of coastal water and a unique diversity of aquatic species and ecosystems. In June 2017, as a strategy to preserve them, 152 hectares of mangroves and coastal habitats were set as a Nature Conservation Area. This formal designation is a testament to our commitment to protect and enhance local biodiversity and ecosystems.</p>

<p>As per our Sustainability Policy and foundational Environmental Stewardship Policy, KAUST has set a series of operational policies, guidelines, and monitoring systems aimed at keeping our aquatic ecosystems healthy while providing opportunities for people to learn about the vast benefits they provide. Bird feeding stations, mangrove planting, beekeeping activities, insect habitat support, nature walks, and classroom activities are examples of public engagement and awareness actions that directly foster the health and protection of our surrounding aquatic and land ecosystems.</p>
<p>The Nature Conservation Area is also home to the Ibn Sina Field Research Station, which hosts long-term experimental and monitoring programs by which KAUST researchers gather important information about the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>This area provides excellent opportunities to observe birds, as do other areas at KAUST, which lies on a major bird migratory route. More than 240 species of resident and migrant birds shelter here throughout the year.</p>
<p>In autumn, migrating birds leave their breeding grounds in Central Eurasia and along the Red Sea to winter in North and East Africa. In the spring, they return to the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Most birds break their long journeys into a series of shorter trips, with multiple stops along the way.</p>
<p>The location is ideal for birdwatching because of its variety of food for birds to replenish their energy supplies, its freshwater for drinking, and its vegetation for cover from predators.</p>

<p><strong>SAFAA GOLF CLUB NATURE CONSERVATION AREA</strong></p>
<p>The Safaa Golf Course is another protected area at KAUST. Seven areas of the course are fully protected, covering 2.2 hectares, and an additional 4.23 hectares of the course are semi-protected areas. These designated areas are managed to provide habitats for local fauna, including resident and migratory bird species. Bird observation “hides” (blinds)—camouflaged shelters used to view wildlife—are located on the Safaa Golf Course and South Beach.</p>
<p><strong>MINIMIZING THE ALTERATION OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS THROUGH MONITORING AND MARINE POLLUTION PREVENTION</strong></p>
<p>Our Environmental Management System (EMS), has been prepared in line with International Standard Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001:2015 requirements for environmental management system and follows a “Plan, Do, Check, Act” process. This includes plans to minimize alterations in aquatic ecosystems and reduce the impact of our overall operations. The system includes water discharge quality standards and a monitoring plan to minimize or eliminate any adverse environmental impacts (e.g. physical, chemical and biological alterations of aquatic ecosystems). To ensure compliance, marine ambient water quality around KAUST is monitored bi-annually. Water samples are collected at multiple on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore locations, and analyzed by an accredited independent laboratory. Results are communicated to and evaluated by the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) department.</p>
<p><strong>MARINE MONITORING</strong></p>
<p>HSE also supervises and ensures the Wastewater Management Procedure is followed, especially by marine research infrastructures such as the Coastal and Marine Resources Core Lab. Additionally, another mechanism to protect the health of the aquatic system is to make sure that any recreational boats discharge grey wastewater in compliance with The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).</p>
<p><strong>FRESHWATER MONITORING</strong></p>
<p>As part of our strategy to improve and maintain the only existent watershed (the manmade golf course lake) and other water bodies at KAUST, HSE routinely monitors these systems’ water quality. One example is the controlling and monitoring of the golf lake discharge that goes into marine areas. The Golf Course Lake System is monitored quarterly from multiple depths and water samples are submitted to an accredited independent laboratory for chemical, physical, and physico-chemical analysis. Approval is then sought from KAUST HSE prior to discharge, being contingent on water quality complying with the marine discharge water guidelines (set in the Wastewater Code), and that the flow volume is recorded.</p>
<p><strong>ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH ON FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>Each year, KAUST’s Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Department leads an educational and outreach programme centered around the University’s freshwater man-made lake; a semi-protected area that serves as both a biodiversity haven and a practical model for sustainable water management.</p>
<p>The lake’s water originates from treated wastewater, demonstrating how reclaimed resources can sustain vibrant ecosystems for migratory birds, aquatic insects, and native plants. Pesticide and insecticide use is intentionally reduced as part of its management strategy, ensuring a healthy balance between vegetation, soil, and the wildlife that depends on them.</p>
<p>During the programme, children and community participants learn field monitoring techniques that mirror real scientific methods. Working in small teams, they conduct water-quality and soil-quality analyses as part of biodiversity-driven projects, interpret their findings, and present their results to peers and mentors. In collaboration with the KAUST Birding Club, participants also help observe and record migratory bird species that rely on the lake’s habitat. Through these hands-on activities, community members gain a deeper understanding of the connection between water quality, soil health, and ecosystem vitality.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, approximately [X community members] take part in [X number of activities] activities, which blend environmental education with practical science. By highlighting how treated water can sustain life beyond human needs, this annual programme demonstrates how effective freshwater management fosters ecosystems where people and nature coexist in balance.</p>
